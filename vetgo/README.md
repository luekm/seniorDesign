### How to run our VetGo project

- **Step 1:** Download our project, and make sure schema `vetgo_db` is in your Mysql DB.  
  ![db][db]  
- **Step 2:** Go to [VetGo/src/main/resources/application.properties](VetGo/src/main/resources/application.properties). At lines 13 and 14, update your Mysql connection user name and password  
  ![UandP][UandP]  

- **Step 3:** Run [VetGo/src/main/java/Spring20232/VetGo/VetGoApplication.java](VetGo/src/main/java/Spring20232/VetGo/VetGoApplication.java)(our team uses _IntelliJ IDEA_ to run the backend). If your Mysql connection username and password are correct, you should be able to run the backend .

- **Step 4:** Go to folder [VetGo/src/main/frontend](VetGo/src/main/frontend) and type `npm install` to install the required components

- **Step 5:** At the same [dir](VetGo/src/main/frontend), type `npm start` to run Expo. You will see your address (at red box location in the screenshot below)(If you run into issues, just run "expo start")  
  ![expo][expo]  

- **Step 6:** Go to [VetGo/src/main/frontend/app/screens/shared/Constants.js](VetGo/src/main/frontend/app/screens/shared/Constants.js). Update `BASE_URL` to ensure the red box area in the screenshot below matches the red box area shown at the step 5.  
  ![baseUrl][baseUrl]  

- **Step 7:** Ctrl+C to exit Expo and retype `npm start` to restart it. You should be able to open frontend and connect to the backend
  <br><br/>

**Note 1:** You can use the mobile app _Expo Go_ to scan the QR code and launch the VetGo.

**Note 2:** You can install _Android Studio_ (using Windows as an example), and in _Android Studio_, set up Android emulator, then back to system and set up your system Environment Variables. In _system variable_, add _ANDROID_HOME_ as follows:  
![AH][AH]  
At _system variable\path_, add following:  
![AHpath][AHpath]  
Then you should be able to run VetGo in Android emulator.

**Note 3:** After start the backend, You can use _http://localhost:8080/api/user/demo_ in your browser to add the test users into DB. All test usersâ€™ password is `123456`  
![testUsers][testUsers]  

<br><br/>

### How to run the backend

- **Step 1:** In springboot, run as maven build

- **Step 2:** In the mavin build configuration, type into the Goal section "package", then apply and run

- **Step 3:** When it builds successfully a jar file is created, switch over to Filezilla (or application of your choice)

- **Step 4:** In Filezilla, go into the target folder for the jar file

- **Step 5:** Once in the target folder, do a quick connect

**Note:** If you haven't connected before you will have to fill in Host, Username, Password and Port
** The Host can be found in the application.properties file under spring.datasource.url. Only include coms<...>.edu
** The Username and Password are your iastate username and password
** The Port is always 22

- **Step 6:** Drag the jar file to the remote side (this puts it into the server directly)

- **Step 7:** In a terminal ssh into the server

- **Step 8:** run the line $java -jar <Jar File Name>
